## Where I could have done better / parting thoughts

I had a lot of fun with this, but there was lots of room for improvement.

* A habit I am still trying to break is design for desktop first. Everytime I have designed mobile first, life is always much easier- I have enjoyed using the tailwindcss to address this in the past with great success, but it shouldn't be something that prevents me from doing it without it.

* Along that note, though I did mock out some wireframes - I could have made more of an effort to start with the mobile frame instead of the desktop.

* I think my css is a bit messy and has room to be cleaned up. I could also make better use of rems.

* I don't have any aria in my application =(

* My sorting functionality can be cleaned up, the alphabetical and difficulty sorts can be turned into a single method

* I would like to present the sorting features in a better manner.. having buttons at the top =/ - I think having some `^`'s by title and difficulty would have been a better experience there.

* Sorting by food types could be in a dropdown to accomidate many different food types

* Mobile navigation - no hamburger menu

* TypeScript - This is a really cool technology I will be using in the future. I think the mistake I made here was not implenting it from the get go.. I wanted to see what it would be like to convert the application over from vue and this has be tripping over my feet a bit.

* As a result of not having TypeScript going from the get go- one of the unexpected consequences is my tests fail all day long. Things are not being picked up and passed around the way I am used too. I believe once I get TypeScript implemented properly testing this will be a breeze!
